Pyramid 1.0b6 is available for download:

http://dl.metrix.net/support/dist/

Pyramid is binary linux distro for use on x86 embedded platforms. It is primarily focused on wireless applications however people have found many great uses for it. We primarily develop and test Pyramid for Metrix Kits, but it works well on other x86 based hardware as well. Check the WorkingHardware page for more info or add to it if you find hardware not listed that works with Pyramid.

Who maintains pyramid?

Pyramid was created at <a href='http://metrix.net/'>Metrix Communication LLC</a>, and is still maintained there, but bringing more people on board the Pyramid team to move the OS further has always been the plan.  The goal has always been to make Pyramid as flexible as possible, while still operating within the restraints of it's target hardware.  Our hope is that by moving the code and wiki to Google Code, we will be able to speed some things up as well as avoid the hassle of hosting it ourselves.

Supporting Pyramid Development?

One easy way to support Pyramid is by choosing to buy gear from Metrix. In addition if there is hardware you want supported in Pyramid, donating such hardware to the project will help get support in Pyramid and make sure its tested from release to release.  We have a lot of stuff, but we don't have every strange card that gets released every couple of months.

Testing

Obviously QA and Testing is a big part of release management, and we have very little formal framework set up for this, which is why all releases up to this point have been considered BETA.   If you interested in helping us build a test framework, it would be appreciated.

Mailing Lists

We've moved our mailing lists to a single Google Group, and the old archives from 2006-2008 haven't been lost, but they're not online anymore (the dingo ate my mailman!)

If someone shows interest, I'm sure they can be brought back online.

This wiki here (now at google code) aims to be the main source of documentation for Pyramid. If you are a Pyramid user or developer you are encouraged to use this wiki to document your work to share with others.
